# CLI-Proxy-Checker
Proxy connection checker /  proxy checker

## Why i made this.

I made this because i wanted to learn libcurl and multi threading :)

## Bugs:
When selecting the https option i get "A requested feature, protocol or option was not found built-in in this libcurl due to a build-time decision." fix this.
